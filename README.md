> Simple Python game about shooting asteroids

This project is a part of [boot.dev's](https://www.boot.dev) courses. The goal is to create a functional asteroid shooting game. The user controls
a small ship and shoots small to large asteroids. Large asteroids split into smaller ones until a certain threshold, where they are 
deleted from the game.

## Features

- WASD/SPACE controls
- Infinite asteroid field

## Future Features
These are recommended additions to the game that boot.dev offers as an exentsion to implement. I will try to add more to the game over time
but if you would like to help, contribute to the project! It does not have to be one of these options.

- Add a scoring system
- Implement multiple lives and respawning
- Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- Add acceleration to the player movement
- Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
- Add a background image
- Create different weapon types
- Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
- Add a shield power-up
- Add a speed power-up
- Add bombs that can be dropped
